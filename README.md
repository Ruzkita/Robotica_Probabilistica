#ROS2 Teaching Projet for Undergratuated Students
This repository was created as a starting point for undergraduate students interested in learning about the Robot Operating System (ROS) â€” a robust and widely used robotics framework in the industry for a variety of applications. The course is structured into four modules, described below, with the following objectives: 

1 - Provide an introductory overview of robotics concepts and robot modeling;

2 - Introduce the ROS ecosystem and its communication mechanisms with robotic hardware;

3 - Explore the use of robot simulators to validate and test system functionality;

4 - Present a gentle introduction to computer vision and path planning concepts.

At the end of each module, students are given a practical challenge to apply their knowledge and reinforce learning through hands-on experience.
